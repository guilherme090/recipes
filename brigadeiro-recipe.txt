Ingredients:
 - 1 can sweet condensed milk
 - 4 tablespoons cocoa powder (100%)
 - 2 tablespoons butter
 - a pinch of salt
 - 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
 - 1 teaspoon salt
 - sprinkles

Directions:

 1. In a small sauce pan mix the sweet condensed milk, the cocoa powder, 
    the salt and the butter.

 2. Bring the sauce pan to the stove and heat it over medium-low heat.

 3. Cook it, mixing constantly (this is important, otherwise it will burn!) 
    until it thickens. A way to know is to run your wooden spoon (or spatula) 
    in the middle of the mixture. If it takes a while for the mixture to move, 
    then your brigadeiro is ready!

 4. Reserve, letting it cool to room temperature.
 
 5. In a plate or bowl, spread your sprinkles.

 6. Once the brigadeiro is cool, grease your hands with butter and roll the 
    brigadeiros into little balls.(In Brazil we usually use half a tablespoon 
    as measurement, but you can make your balls as big or small as you'd like!)

 7. Roll the brigadeiro balls into the sprinkles and place them in paper/foil candy cups.
